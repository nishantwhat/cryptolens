Dive into the wild world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin as we clean, crunch, and visualize real-time data using R. From price swings to meme-coin madness, this project compares trends, volatility, and market behavior with style. 🚀📉📈 Let the data tell the crypto story!
# CryptoLens

**CryptoLens** is a comparative data analysis project focused on exploring the behavior of three major cryptocurrencies — **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **Dogecoin** — using time-series data and statistical techniques in **R**.

The project analyzes a decade (2013–2023) of historical data to uncover trends, volatility, and the impact of major events (e.g., COVID-19, social media activity, network upgrades) on cryptocurrency markets.

## 📌 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world crypto datasets
- Time-series formatting, outlier handling, and imputation
- Rolling averages and trend visualizations
- Comparative analysis of market behavior
- Literature-backed insight into technical and social drivers

## 📁 Dataset Overview

We worked with publicly available datasets containing:

- Price history
- Market capitalization
- Trading volume
- Timestamps

Each cryptocurrency dataset was preprocessed for consistency and analytical readiness.

## 📊 Tools & Techniques

- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `zoo`, `tidyverse`  
- **Methods**:
  - Missing value treatment and forward-fill
  - Outlier detection and removal
  - Rolling average (e.g., 30-day SMA)
  - Visualization of volatility and market movement

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Bitcoin** showed strong correlation with macroeconomic trends and institutional interest.
- **Ethereum** responded to smart contract adoption and major network upgrades.
- **Dogecoin** exhibited high sensitivity to social media sentiment (e.g., tweet-driven spikes).
- All three assets experienced significant shifts during the COVID-19 period.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened our understanding of:

- Time-series data handling in R  
- Comparative data analysis in volatile markets  
- Real-world impact of social and technical factors on cryptocurrencies  
- Backing findings with relevant literature and academic framing
